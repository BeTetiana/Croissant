    <h1>How to Make Croissants</h1>
    <p>
      Today we’re conquering our fears and making homemade croissants! If you’re
      about to run away screaming, I understand. I’m not sugarcoating it:
      croissants aren’t easy. Croissants require time, patience, and a lot of
      rolling. However, just because this recipe is advanced doesn’t mean that
      YOU have to be an advanced baker to try it. You can absolutely handle this
      recipe. ♥
    </p>
    <p>
      Let me hold your hand through the whole process. I’m sharing step-by-step
      photography, a full video tutorial, plenty of tricks based on what I’ve
      learned, and the croissant recipe. I started working on croissants earlier
      this year. I studied a couple recipes, tested them, tweaked what I found
      necessary, and played with this dough for weeks. The croissants are golden
      brown, extra flaky, crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and
      unbelievable warm from the oven. One bite of this delicate French pastry
      will immediately transport you to a quaint French bakery. I’m confident in
      this homemade croissants recipe and I’m confident in YOU baking them.

    <p>
      The good news! You need zero fancy equipment and zero special ingredients.
      If you’re looking for a weekend project, know how to read directions, and
      crave a fresh homemade pastry (don’t we all?), then stick around. You’ll
      be rewarded with the BEST treat ever!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Let’s get right into it. Making croissants is a labor of love. The long
      recipe directions and all these step-by-step photographs seem
      intimidating, but let me walk you through the basic process so you aren’t
      nervous.
    </p>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk</li>
      <li>roll out dough into a large rectangle</li>
      <li>make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)</li>
      <li>enclose the butter layer inside the dough</li>
      <li>
        roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back
        together
      </li>
      <li>roll out the dough again, fold it back together again</li>
      <li>roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together</li>
      <li>shape the croissants</li>
      <li>bake</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There’s resting time between most steps, which means most of the time is
      hands off. To help us develop all the layers, croissant dough needs to
      rest in the refrigerator often. That’s why I call making croissants a
      project. Do it over a couple days with long breaks between the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      All that rolling out and folding back together? That’s called LAMINATING.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Laminated Dough?</h2>
    <p>
      Laminating dough is the process of folding butter into dough many times,
      which creates multiple alternating layers of butter and dough. When the
      laminated dough bakes, the butter melts and creates steam. This steam
      lifts the layers apart, leaving us with dozens of flaky airy buttery
      layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like we do when we make a croissant bread loaf, We’re going to
      laminate the dough 3 times, which will create 81 layers in our croissants.
      Yes, 81! Let me paint that picture for you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with dough, butter layer, dough = 3 layers</li>
      <li>Roll it out and fold it into thirds = 9 layers</li>
      <li>Roll that out and fold it into thirds = 27 layers</li>
      <li>Roll that out one last time and fold it into thirds = 81 layers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So we’re only laminating the dough 3 times, but that gives us 81 layers.
      When the croissants are rolled up and shaped, that’s one 81 layer dough
      rolled up many times. So when you bite into a croissant, you’re literally
      biting into hundreds of layers.
