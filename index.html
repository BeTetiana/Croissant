      <h1>How to Make Croissants</h1>
      <p>
        Today we’re conquering our fears and making homemade croissants! If
        you’re about to run away screaming, I understand. I’m not sugarcoating
        it: croissants aren’t easy. Croissants require time, patience, and a lot
        of rolling. However, just because this recipe is advanced doesn’t mean
        that YOU have to be an advanced baker to try it. You can absolutely
        handle this recipe. ♥
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me hold your hand through the whole process. I’m sharing
        step-by-step photography, a full video tutorial, plenty of tricks based
        on what I’ve learned, and the croissant recipe. I started working on
        croissants earlier this year. I studied a couple recipes, tested them,
        tweaked what I found necessary, and played with this dough for weeks.
        The croissants are golden brown, extra flaky, crisp on the outside, soft
        on the inside, and unbelievable warm from the oven. One bite of this
        delicate French pastry will immediately transport you to a quaint French
        bakery. I’m confident in this homemade croissants recipe and I’m
        confident in YOU baking them.
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news! You need zero fancy equipment and zero special
        ingredients. If you’re looking for a weekend project, know how to read
        directions, and crave a fresh homemade pastry (don’t we all?), then
        stick around. You’ll be rewarded with the BEST treat ever!!!

        Let’s get right into it. Making croissants is a labor of love. The long
        recipe directions and all these step-by-step photographs seem
        intimidating, but let me walk you through the basic process so you
        aren’t nervous.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Process</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>make easy dough from butter, flour, sugar, salt, yeast, and milk</li>
      <li>roll out dough into a large rectangle</li>
      <li>make the butter layer (I have an easy trick for this!!!)</li>
      <li>enclose the butter layer inside the dough</li>
      <li>
        roll out the dough into another large rectangle, then fold it back
        together
      </li>
      <li>roll out the dough again, fold it back together again</li>
      <li>roll out the dough one more time, fold it back together</li>
      <li>shape the croissants</li>
      <li>bake</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      There’s resting time between most steps, which means most of the time is
      hands off. To help us develop all the layers, croissant dough needs to
      rest in the refrigerator often. That’s why I call making croissants a
      project. Do it over a couple days with long breaks between the steps.
    </p>
    <img src="img/homemade-croissants-8.jpg" alt="" />
    <p>
      All that rolling out and folding back together? That’s called LAMINATING.
    </p>
    <h2>What is Laminated Dough?</h2>
    <p>
      Laminating dough is the process of folding butter into dough many times,
      which creates multiple alternating layers of butter and dough. When the
      laminated dough bakes, the butter melts and creates steam. This steam
      lifts the layers apart, leaving us with dozens of flaky airy buttery
      layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just like we do when we make a croissant bread loaf, We’re going to
      laminate the dough 3 times, which will create 81 layers in our croissants.
      Yes, 81! Let me paint that picture for you.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Start with dough, butter layer, dough = 3 layers</li>
      <li>Roll it out and fold it into thirds = 9 layers</li>
      <li>Roll that out and fold it into thirds = 27 layers</li>
      <li>Roll that out one last time and fold it into thirds = 81 layers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      So we’re only laminating the dough 3 times, but that gives us 81 layers.
      When the croissants are rolled up and shaped, that’s one 81 layer dough
      rolled up many times. So when you bite into a croissant, you’re literally
      biting into hundreds of layers.

        <li>
          <strong>Preliminary notes:</strong> Watch the video above and use the
          step-by-step photos before you begin. Read the recipe before
          beginning. Make room in the refrigerator for a baking sheet. In step 6
          and again in step 13, you will need room for 2 baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Make the dough:</strong> Cut the butter in four 1-Tablespoon
          pieces and place in the bowl of an electric stand mixer fitted with
          the dough hook attachment (or you can use a handheld mixer or no
          mixer, but a stand mixer is ideal). Add the flour, sugar, salt, and
          yeast. Turn the mixer on low-medium speed to gently combine the
          ingredients for 1 minute. With the mixer running, slowly pour in the
          milk. Once all of the milk is added, turn the mixer up to medium speed
          and beat the dough for at least 5 full minutes. (If you don’t have a
          mixer, knead by hand for 5 minutes.) The dough will be soft. It will
          (mostly) pull away from the sides of the bowl and if you poke it with
          your finger, it will bounce back. If after 5 minutes the dough is too
          sticky, keep the mixer running until it pulls away from the sides of
          the bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove dough from the bowl and, with floured hands, work it into a
          ball. Place the dough on a lightly floured silicone baking mat lined,
          lightly floured parchment paper lined, or lightly floured baking
          sheet. (I highly recommend a silicone baking mat because you can roll
          the dough out in the next step directly on top and it won’t slide all
          over the counter.) Gently flatten the dough out, as I do in the video
          above, and cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil. Place the entire
          baking sheet in the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest
          in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shape the dough:</strong> Remove the dough from the
          refrigerator. I like to keep the dough on the silicone baking mat when
          I’m rolling it in this step because the mat is nonstick and it’s a
          handy guide for the exact measurement. Begin flattening out the dough
          with your hands. You’re rolling it out into a rectangle in this step,
          so shaping it with your hands first helps the stretchy dough. Roll it
          into a 14×10-inch rectangle. The dough isn’t extremely cold after only
          30 minutes in the refrigerator, so it will feel more like soft
          play-doh. Be precise with the measurement. The dough will want to be
          oval shaped, but keep working the edges with your hands and rolling
          pin until you have the correct size rectangle.
        </li>

        <li>
          <strong>Long rest:</strong> Place the rolled out dough back onto the
          baking sheet (this is why I prefer a silicone baking mat or parchment
          because you can easily transfer the dough). Cover the rolled out dough
          with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, place the entire baking sheet in
          the refrigerator and allow the covered dough to rest in the
          refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>
            Butter layer (begin this 35 minutes before the next step so the
            butter can chill for 30 minutes):</strong
          >
          In a large bowl using a hand-held mixer or stand mixer fitted with a
          paddle or whisk attachment, beat the butter and flour together until
          smooth and combined. Transfer the mixture to a silicone baking mat
          lined or parchment paper lined baking sheet. (Silicone baking mat is
          preferred because you can easily peel the butter off in the next
          step.) Using a spoon or small spatula, smooth out into a 7×10-inch
          rectangle. Be as precise as you can with this measurement. Place the
          entire baking sheet in the refrigerator and chill the butter layer for
          30 minutes. (No need to cover it for only 30 minutes.) You want the
          butter layer firm, but still pliable. If it gets too firm, let it sit
          out on the counter for a few minutes to gently soften. The more firm
          the butter layer is the more difficult it will be to laminate the
          dough in the next step.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Laminate the dough:</strong> In this next step, you will be
          rolling out the dough into a large rectangle. Do this on a lightly
          floured counter instead of rolling out on your silicone baking mat.
          The counter is typically a little cooler (great for keeping the dough
          cold) and the silicone baking mat is smaller than the measurement you
          need. Remove both the dough and butter layers from the refrigerator.
          Place the butter layer in the center of the dough and fold each end of
          the dough over it. If the butter wasn’t an exact 7×10-inch rectangle,
          use a pizza cutter or sharp knife to even out the edges. Seal the
          dough edges over the butter layer as best you can with your fingers.
          On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough into a 10×20-inch
          rectangle. It’s best to roll back and forth with the shorter end of
          the dough facing you, like I do in the video above. Use your fingers
          if you need to. The dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm
          muscle to roll. Again, the dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep
          working it with your hands and rolling pin until you have the correct
          size rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were
          folding a letter. This was the 1st turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          If the dough is now too warm to work with, place folded dough on the
          baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and
          refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 2nd turn. I usually don’t have
          to.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>2nd turn:</strong> Turn the dough so the short end is facing
          you. Roll the dough out once again into a 10×20-inch rectangle, then
          fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you were folding a letter.
          The dough must be refrigerated between the 2nd and 3rd turn because it
          has been worked with a lot by this point. Place the folded dough on
          the baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and
          refrigerate for 30 minutes before the 3rd turn.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>3rd turn:</strong> Roll the dough out once again into a
          10×20-inch rectangle. Fold the dough lengthwise into thirds as if you
          were folding a letter.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Long rest:</strong> Place the folded dough on the lined baking
          sheet, cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil, and refrigerate for 4
          hours or overnight. (Up to 24 hours is ok.)
        </li>
        <li>
          At the end of the next step, you’ll need 2 baking sheets lined with
          silicone baking mats or parchment paper. The dough is currently on a
          lined baking sheet in the refrigerator, so you already have 1
          prepared!
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shape the croissants:</strong> Remove the dough from the
          refrigerator. On a lightly floured counter, roll the dough out into an
          8×20-inch rectangle. Use your fingers if you need to. Once again, the
          dough is very cold, so it will take a lot of arm muscle to roll. The
          dough will want to be oval shaped, but keep working it with your hands
          and rolling pin until you have the correct size rectangle. Using a
          pizza cutter or sharp knife, slice the dough in half vertically. Each
          skinny rectangle will be 4-inches wide. Then cut 3 even slices
          horizontally, yielding 8 4×5-inch rectangles. See photo and video
          above for a visual. Cut each rectangle diagonally to make 2 triangles.
          You have 16 triangles now. Work with one triangle at a time. Using
          your fingers or a rolling pin, stretch the triangle to be about 8
          inches long. Do this gently as you do not want to flatten the layers.
          Cut a small slit at the wide end of the triangle, then tightly roll up
          into a crescent shape making sure the tip is underneath. Slightly bend
          the ends in towards each other. Repeat with remaining dough, placing
          the shaped croissants on 2 lined baking sheets, 8 per sheet. Loosely
          cover with plastic wrap or aluminum foil and allow to rest at room
          temperature (no warmer– I suggest keeping on the counter) for 1 hour,
          then place in the refrigerator to rest for 1 hour or up to 12 hours.
          (Or freeze, see freezing instructions.) I prefer the shaped croissants
          to be cold going into the oven.
        </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400°F (204°C).</li>
        <li>
          <strong>Egg wash:</strong> Whisk the egg wash ingredients together.
          Remove the croissants from the refrigerator. Brush each lightly with
          egg wash.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Bake the croissants:</strong> Bake until croissants are golden
          brown, about 20 minutes. Rotate the pans halfway through baking. If
          croissants show signs of darkening too quickly, reduce the oven to
          375°F (190°C).
        </li>
        <li>
          Remove croissants from the oven and place on a wire rack to cool for a
          few minutes before serving. They will slightly deflate as they cool.
        </li>
        <li>
          Croissants taste best the same day they’re baked. Cover any leftover
          croissants and store at room temperature for a few days or in the
          refrigerator for up to 1 week. You can also freeze for up to 3 months,
          then thaw on the counter or overnight in the refrigerator. Warm up to
          your liking.
